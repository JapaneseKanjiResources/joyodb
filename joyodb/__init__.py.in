# with brackets [] in the PDF.  These can be represented by Unicode variation
# sequences[1].  Sadly, at the moment of this writing (2016), very few software
# support such sequences.  At any rate, I've hand-picked Unicode variations
# that look like the reference images, because this is "forward-compatible" –
# these sequences can be useful in the future, when Unicode support gets more
# widespread.
